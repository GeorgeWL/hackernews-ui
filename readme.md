Using https://github.com/HackerNews/API create a React user interface that will display a list of the top 10 current posts from hacker news.

Each post should be clickable and will open a sensibly sized collapsible panel containing meta data about the post and also the current top 3 comments and any meta data about that comment

each of the comments should then show the top 3 children of that comment

repeated until there are no more children to display.

This page should be sensibly styled for an easy to digest, modern, user interface. We are looking for clean code that is reusable and maintainable.
